                <p>Aarin R. Wilson is a drawing and print media artist from Philadelphia, PA, who is a senior at The University of The Arts. She explores the interest of media and color in expression of emotion, commonly emphasized with her prints and mark on paper. She is influenced by artists such as David Shrigley, with use of text and free floating imagery, and Geloy Concepcion, a photography emphasized artist who reworks old family imagery to embellish emotions with text and censorship of identities for deepend meanings. These artists have common themes that motivate her to do the same story telling through works embodying life experiences and conceptualized struggles heavily affected by family and illness. Wilson has received The Dean's Award for artistic merit and an Academic Achievement award from her university and nominations for competitive artist residencies such as Yale Norfolk School of Art in December of 2021.

                <p>My artwork is a collection of romanticized sadness, bringing appealing imagery as the front runner of personalized hardships. With honesty, my work is selfish, it's made for me but to be shared with others. My art is how I reach out about my woes and see if there's a bite of connection or relevancy to my audience. My life experiences were consistently hard at a young age and plentiful nonetheless. Using my drawings and prints to cope, from the idea, to the making, the works are a physical embodiment of acceptance and understanding, and it seems it helps others do the same. A common theme of imagery I use are remembered still lifes that have had an impact, like a snapshot of a moment that pesters me till it’s placed on a page, having me question my fixation on the subject and what was truly joining on when I captured the moment. like purged memories in a childlike way, my imagery is embellished with eye catching colors and easily defined lines, encapsulating many pathways to a bigger story.</p>
